Erlang Sudoku solver

Version 0.something

Right now it can solve standard 9x9 solvable sudokus, i.e,
sudokus which are not under-determined.

It is a plain erlang file, so you have to compile it by hand.

A sudoku is internally represented by a 9x9 matrix, all
accessor functions work with row, column parameters.
e.g.
  set(1,2,3)
sets the cell in row 1 and column 2 to the value 3.

Usage:
c(sudoku).
sudoku:start().
sudoku:set(1,2,4). % sets cell[1,2] to value 4
[..]
sudoku:printClean().
